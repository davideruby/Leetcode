## [389. Find the Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/)

${\textsf{\color{green}Easy}}$

You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        counter_s = Counter(s)
        counter_t = Counter(t)

        for char in t:
            if counter_s[char] == counter_t[char] - 1:
                return char
```
