## [15. 3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)

<h2 style="color:#fac31d">Medium</h2>
Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        answer = []
        nums.sort()
        idx = 0

        while idx < len(nums):
            while idx > 0 and idx < len(nums) and nums[idx - 1] == nums[idx]:
                idx += 1

            jdx = idx + 1
            kdx = len(nums) - 1
            while jdx < kdx:
                three_sum = nums[idx] + nums[jdx] + nums[kdx]

                if three_sum < 0:
                    jdx += 1
                elif three_sum > 0:
                    kdx -= 1
                else:
                    answer.append([nums[idx], nums[jdx], nums[kdx]])
                    jdx += 1
                    kdx -= 1

                    while jdx < kdx and nums[jdx - 1] == nums[jdx]:
                        jdx += 1
                    while jdx < kdx and nums[kdx + 1] == nums[kdx]:
                        kdx -= 1

            idx += 1

        return answer
```

## Notes
- I didn't find it straightforward to solve. First, you have to sort the array. Then, set the first number with a loop. The second and third number have to be found as in the 2-sum problem, using two indexes, one starting from the beginning and the other one starting from the end.
- Another tricky point is the one of avoiding duplicates. You have to update the indexes properly (see the code).
